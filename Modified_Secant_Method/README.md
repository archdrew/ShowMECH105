## This function finds the root of a function using the secant method
# this open method of finding the root is beneficial because no derivative is reqiuired in the calculations
Inputs: 
    *  x0 = lower bound representing xn -1 
    *  x1 = upper bound representing xn 
    *  es = stopping criterion
    *  maxiter = max # of iterations loop will take 
 Outputs:
    *  root = where the funciton crosses the x axis 
    *  ea = the approximate error percentage when root found
    *  iter = the amount of iterations that were needed to find root
