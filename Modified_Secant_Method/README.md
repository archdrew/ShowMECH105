## This function finds the root of a function using the secant method
# this open method of finding the root is beneficial because no derivative is reqiuired in the calculations
# Inputs: 
1. x0 = lower bound representing xn -
2.   x1 = upper bound representing xn 
3.     es = stopping criterion
4.      maxiter = max # of iterations loop will take 
 # Outputs:
 5. root = where the funciton crosses the x axis
 6.  ea = the approximate error percentage when root found
 7.  iter = the amount of iterations that were needed to find root
